### Description
This is going to be a long-term project where I try to teach myself more about programming by programming an interpreter. 
Most of the stuff that I will be doing is going to be based off the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystorm.
While this project is in its early early stages I do hope to be able to start making blog posts in the future about my progress and the things that I
have learned throughout the building of my first interpreter.
